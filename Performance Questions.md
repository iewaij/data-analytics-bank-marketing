Precision-recall curves (PR curves) are recommended for highly skewed domains where ROC curves may provide an excessively optimistic view of the performance.

— A Survey of Predictive Modelling under Imbalanced Distributions, 2015.

Although ROC graphs are widely used to evaluate classifiers under presence of class imbalance, it has a drawback: under class rarity, that is, when the problem of class imbalance is associated to the presence of a low sample size of minority instances, as the estimates can be unreliable.

References [Davis2006] and [Flach2015] describe why a linear interpolation of points on the precision-recall curve provides an overly-optimistic measure of classifier performance.
